        With the advancement of machine learning and artificial intelligence tools, there has also been significant progress in text-to-speech (TTS)
        and voice conversion (VC) technologies, which can replicate a target voice. These technologies are often exploited—frequently in combination with 
        deepfake videos—for various fraudulent activities targeting businesses, politicians and ordinary individuals.
        The aim of this thesis is to evaluate the capability of a model trained on English or Chinese—languages for which datasets containing both 
        genuine and spoofed speech are available—and to develop the first, or one of the first, tools for detecting such machine-generated speech in the Czech language.

        In order to develop and train such a tool and to evaluate models trained in English, it is first necessary to create a dataset 
        containing both natural and spoofed Czech speech. <b>More details can be found <a href="dataset.html">here</a>. </b>
