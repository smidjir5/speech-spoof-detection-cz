    <h2>Dataset making</h2>
    <p>
        For generating spoof utterances I used two bonafide datasets. First of them is in-house dataset "CTU Test" which contains 2169 phonetically rich utterances from 43 speakers. Second one is 
        czech subset from <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/facebook/voxpopuli" target="_blank">Voxpopuli</a> containg 62 hours of speech from 138 speakers recorded in Europian parliament.
        More datasets will be used. Too long and too short utterances were ignored.
